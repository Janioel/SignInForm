I did this project because i was aiming to learn how CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) works in PHP;
This project was based in the YouTube video "PHP CRUD || Create, Read, Update, Delete." https://youtu.be/72U5Af8KUpA;
The forms structure were taken from Bootstrap;
I used XAMPP's Apache Webserver and MySQL DB to store the entire code;
That's basically it. There's nothing much to see here but it was really funny to do and learn about CRUD.
